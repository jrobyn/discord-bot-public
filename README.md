# jayebot-public

>Overview
This is a public version of a Discord bot that I created just for fun, and added to servers I talk in. It has had some server specific commands removed, but is otherwise pretty much the same, and now has a lot of features. Anyone is welcome to use the code to help get their own bot working, and to adapt any games and commands for their own purposes.
Many commands are just for fun, like fortune telling, tarot, cute animal pictures, dice rolling, random number games, etc. There are also some conversational commands, like letting the bot choose between two items, answer questions, or send specific action gifs.
One major feature is a working economy. Users can collect daily rewards, mine or scavenge, and gift money to other users. The money can be spent either on a slot machine game or on a gacha 'monster girl' game.
A non exhaustive list of commands can be found in help.txt.

>Guide
To run your own bot you will need to go to create an application on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/, click to reveal 'client secret', and copy that into the TOKEN variable near the top of the code. You can look at how I've written commands here and copy and change whatever you want to.
Note that if you were to use the code as-is, there would have to be a folder created called 'user' for storing people's money and prizes, and also that the emojis in the gacha section would need replacing (one of the bot's servers would need an emoji for every type of gacha capsule, and two wing emojis), but these are easy changes and the bot would otherwise work.
