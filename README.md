This is a Discord bot that I created just for fun, and added to servers I talk in.
It has many commands for fortune telling, random number games, memes, conversation, etc.
It also now has a working economy with daily rewards, a slot machine game, and a monster girl gacha game.

Anyone is welcome to use the code to help get their own bot working, and to adapt any games and commands for their own purposes.
