you wipe the sweat off of your brow
you stub your toe on a rock
you cough up some strange black goo
your muscles ache
your back feels broken
you're worried that you inhaled some coal dust
it was a hard day's work
you notice that your boss makes a lot more than you do
you watched a man disappear down a mine shaft
someone died in a cave-in today
the new pickaxes are really flimsy
you have nightmares about the darkness
you got lost in the tunnels for three hours
