lots of tiny worms
a plague of frogs
the skeleton war
the forever war
the line needed to go up
it was good for shareholders
the universe is chaotic and unknowable
life is suffering uwu
to help people
to save you from yourself
to make the world more peaceful
to spread peace and love
i got a spoon stuck in the dishwasher
it only exists in that it pleases me
because of big nukes
russian hackers
it seemed right at the time
a retired hitman had to return for one last job
the holy grail was stolen
random chance
human nature
the stars were aligned correctly
it is gods will
the machine god wills it
