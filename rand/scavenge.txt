you scavenge some coins from the trashcan
you sell some discarded banana peel as a bug repellent
you find a teddy bear with one eye in the trash
you sell some random bits of metal you found
you sell some oysters that showed up on the beach
you sell a stray dog that was wandering around in an alleyway
you scavenge some discarded cans to sell
you find a wallet on the floor
someone feels sorry for you and throws you some coins
you sell some artisinal macaroni art
you sell a bunch of electronic waste
you scavenge a few notes from someone's pocket
you sell some old bottlecaps
you find an empty car battery
you find an abandoned tire
